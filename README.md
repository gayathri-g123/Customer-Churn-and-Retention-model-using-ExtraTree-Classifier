# Customer-Churn-and-Retention-model-using-ExtraTree-Classifier
# Customer Churn Prediction and Retention

This project focuses on predicting customer churn and implementing retention strategies using machine learning. The solution involves an Extra Tree Classifier as the proposed model for enhanced accuracy.
The pipeline includes:

Business Problem Identification: Understanding the impact of customer churn and the need for retention strategies.  
Dataset Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure quality.  
Feature Engineering: Transforming and creating relevant features for model training.  
Feature Selection: Identifying the most impactful features.  
Model Selection: Evaluating multiple machine learning models to identify the best fit.  
Proposed Model: Extra Tree Classifier chosen for its superior performance.  
Performance Metrics: Assessing model accuracy and effectiveness using standard evaluation metrics.

The project delivers actionable insights to help businesses minimize churn and improve customer retention.
